# K-means Clustering

An unsupervised learning algorithm. It can easily understand like firstly set up some cluster and classify the elements. After we get the classified elements find their new center and repeat this until the center is unchanged.

There are a popular method called Hierarchial Clustering, this method contain 2 types:

- Agglomerative (Bottom Up): In this type all data points is considered as a cluster then they will be wraped up into a bigger cluster

- Divisive (Top Down): Firstly all the data points are in a cluster then they will be divided into smaller cluster
